## Progress

This repository is for **learning and experimentation**, not perfection.  
Code may be refactored or improved as I learn more.

## Future Plans

- Add more DOM exercises
- Build small DOM mini-projects
- Refactor older code with better practices
- MAKE THE WEBPAGES RESPONSIVE

Learning in progress, Today I am a beginner, next time a pro.
